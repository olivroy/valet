## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or NOTEs

There was 1 WARNING:

  * checking for unstated dependencies in examples ... OK
WARNING
‘qpdf’ is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs

I believe this is a result of R 4.0.0 convention and it seems fine to ignore.

## Downstream dependencies

There are no downstream dependencies
