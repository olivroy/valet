## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a URL to the Valet API in the Description field of DESCRIPTION

* Converted F to FALSE in R/valet.Rd and R/get_details.Rd

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

There were 2 NOTEs:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Corey Runkel <runkelcorey@gmail.com>'
  New submission
  
This is my first CRAN submission

* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
  
I have checked my examples for any interactivity and, seeing none, believe this
is due to since-deleted vignettes

## Downstream dependencies

There are no downstream dependencies
